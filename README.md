# Hey there 👋

## 🤖 About  
Computer Engineer with a strong AI/ML background. I’ve built and shipped deep tech products, scalable training pipelines, and real-world AI systems—from prototype to production and beyond.

## 💼 Work  
Previously Tech Lead at 🇨🇭 Prem, where I led the development of distributed training pipelines and deep tech products. Before that, ML Engineer at 🇩🇪 Bonial, delivering AI solutions end-to-end.  

Currently exploring new ideas at the intersection of AI, product, and scale.
